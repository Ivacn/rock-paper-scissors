# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended).  The rules are supposed to be like this:  Rock smashes scissors. Paper covers rock. Scissors cut paper.
